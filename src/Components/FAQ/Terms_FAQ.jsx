            <p class="mb-6">The following terms and conditions apply to projects undertaken by www.amzvistas.com:</p>
    
        
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">COPYRIGHT</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">You will own the copyright to all the content we create for you and deliver according to the agreed terms. We will not have any copyright to the content, and you are free to publish and use it as you see fit.</p>
        
            
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">PAYMENT</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">100% advance payment is required for all services listed on our website. The client is responsible for all transaction fees and taxes (if applicable).</p>

            
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">REVISIONS</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">We offer unlimited revisions on work that has been delivered, as long as the requests are made within 14 days of delivery. All revision requests will be completed according to the urgency of the order, with a standard minimum turnaround time of 24 hours. Please note that we continue to offer unlimited revisions until the draft receives the customer’s full approval.</p>
<p  class="mb-6"  >Revisions come into play at the end of the order process, once the product has been presented for review and the status has been updated to "Waiting for Customer Approval." At this time, the customer may request revisions directly by sending their assigned Project Manager an email to ensure that the original provided requirements have been met on the entire product.
</p>         
  <p  class="mb-6"  >
  Additionally, the customer is always welcome to make changes personally to any content they receive from us after the order has been fulfilled and before publishing, as it is delivered in a Word format, and they own the rights to it. This empowers our clients to have full control over the final product and make any desired adjustments to align with their preferences and objectives. 
    </p>          
    
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">CHANGE OF MIND</h2>

We believe in maintaining the integrity of our refund policy, and we encourage clients to carefully consider their projects before proceeding.</p>
